Araali Support Matrix
======================

Araali supports both VMs and Kubernetes running on Linux. The free assessment is currently available for Kubernetes only.

Araali leverages eBPF technology which is generally available in kernel 4.10 onwards. `Watch this talk <https://youtu.be/7pmXdG8-7WU>`_  to learn more about eBPF.

Below is the list of versions we have actively tested out, but we believe we would cover more than what's listed here. If you are having any issues, contact us via the `slack channel <https://araali-networks-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community.html>`_.
