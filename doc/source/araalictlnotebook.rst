Notebook Doc
============
Araali creates per app diagrams out of the box. These are not just diagrams,
they actually represent policies that have been automatically figured out for
you. All that is needed of you is review. Once reviewed, the diagrams are
natively enforced by our purpose built firewall.

The policy is represented as a link DB, and you can do data science on these
links. This is quite useful as you tinker around with what Araali has
discovered. The same APIs can be run outside of the notebook as a regular
program/script.

For starters, our github repo ships with a `notebook
